# CNN-LSTM Model

This repository was generated from the notebook **CNN LSTM Model-3.ipynb**.

It includes:
- The original notebook under `notebooks/`
- A flattened Python script under `src/train.py`
- A heuristic `requirements.txt`
- A Python/Jupyter-friendly `.gitignore`

## Setup

```bash
# Python 3.10+ recommended
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can run the code extracted from the notebook as a script:

```bash
python src/train.py
```

> Note: Since this was auto-extracted from a notebook, you may want to refactor
> any interactive parts (like display code, inline plots, or file dialogs).
